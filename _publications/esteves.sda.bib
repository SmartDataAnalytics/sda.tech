  Abstract                 = {The curation of a knowledge base is a key task for ensuring the correctness and traceability of the knowledge provided in the said knowledge. This task is often carried out manually by human curators, who attempt to provide reliable facts and their respective sources in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the fact to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. However, this process is very time-consuming, mainly due to the human curators having to scrutinize the web pages retrieved by search engines. This demo paper demonstrate the RESTful implementation for DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) ???????? an approach able to validate facts in RDF by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to support the validation of facts by supplying the user with (1) relevant excerpts of web pages as well as (2) useful additional information including (3) a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. We also provide an extension for finding similar resources obtained from the Linked Data, using the sameas.org service as backend. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate the time frame within which a fact was valid.},

However, with regard to publication and sharing of scientific experiment achievements, we still face problems on searching and ranking these methods. Scouring the Internet to search state-of-the-art information about specific contexts, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), is often a time-consuming task. Besides, this process can lead to an incomplete investigation, either because search engines may return incomplete information or keywords may not be properly defined. To bridge this gap, we present WASOTA, a web portal specifically designed to share and readily present metadata about the state of the art on a specific domains, making the process of searching this information easier.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the main tasks when creating and maintaining knowledge bases is to validate facts and provide sources for them in order to ensure correctness and traceability of the provided knowledge. So far, this task is often addressed by human curators in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents.In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) - an algorithm able to validate facts by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of web pages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate in which time frame a fact was valid. Given that the automatic evaluation of facts has not been paid much attention to so far, generic benchmarks for evaluating these frameworks were not previously available. We thus also present a generic evaluation framework for fact checking and make it publicly available.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decades many machine learning experiments have been published, giving benefit to the scientific progress. In order to compare machine-learning experiment results with each other and collaborate positively, they need to be performed thoroughly on the same computing environment, using the same sample datasets and algorithm configurations. Besides this, practical experience shows that scientists and engineers tend to have large output data in their experiments, which is both difficult to analyze and archive properly without provenance metadata. However, the Linked Data community still misses a light-weight specification for interchanging machine-learning metadata over different architectures to achieve a higher level of interoperability. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel vocabulary dubbed MEX. We show that MEX provides a prompt method to describe experiments with a special focus on data provenance and fulfills the requirements for a long-term maintenance.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite recent efforts to achieve a high level of interoperability of Machine Learning (ML) experiments, positively collaborating with the Reproducible Research context, we still run into the problems created due to the existence of different ML platforms: each of those have a specific conceptualization or schema for representing data and metadata. This scenario leads to an extra coding-effort to achieve both the desired interoperability and a better provenance level as well as a more automatized environment for obtaining the generated results. Hence, when using ML libraries, it is a common task to re-design specific data models (schemata) and develop wrappers to manage the produced outputs. In this article, we discuss this gap focusing on the solution for the question: ``What is the cleanest and lowest-impact solution to achieve both higher interoperability and provenance metadata levels in the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) context and how to facilitate the inherent data querying task?''. We introduce a novel and low impact methodology specifically designed for code built in that context, combining semantic web concepts and reflection in order to minimize the gap for exporting ML metadata in a structured manner, allowing embedded code annotations that are, in run-time, converted in one of the state-of-the-art ML schemas for the Semantic Web: the MEX Vocabulary.},
