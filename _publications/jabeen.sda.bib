  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade, vast amounts of machine-readable structured information have become available through the automation of research processes as well as the increasing popularity of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. A major research challenge today is to perform scalable analysis of large-scale knowledge graphs to facilitate applications like link prediction, knowledge base completion and question answering. Most analytics approaches, which scale horizontally (i.e., can be executed in a distributed environment) work on simple feature-vector-based input rather than more expressive knowledge structures. On the other hand, analytics methods which exploit expressive structures usually do not scale well to very large knowledge bases. This software framework paper describes the ongoing project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA) which supports expressive and scalable semantic analytics by providing functionality for distributed in-memory computing for RDF data. The library provides APIs for RDF storage, querying using SPARQL and forward chaining inference. It includes several machine learning algorithms for RDF knowledge graphs. The article describes the vision, architecture and use cases of SANSA.},

  Abstract                 = {The management and analysis of large-scale datasets -- described with the term Big Data -- involves the three classic dimensions volume, velocity and variety. While the former two are well supported by a plethora of software components, the variety dimension is still rather neglected. We present the BDE platform -- an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use and adaptable (cluster-based and standalone) platform for the execution of big data components and tools like Hadoop, Spark, Flink. The BDE platform was designed based upon the requirements gathered from the seven societal challenges put forward by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 programme and targeted by the BigDataEurope pilots. As a result, the BDE platform allows to perform a variety of Big Data flow tasks like message passing (Kafka, Flume), storage (Hive, Cassandra) or publishing (GeoTriples). In order to facilitate the processing of heterogeneous data, a particular innovation of the platform is the semantic layer, which allows to directly process RDF data and to map and transform arbitrary data into RDF.},
