  Abstract                 = {Supply Chain Management aims at optimizing the flow of goods and services from the producer to the consumer. Closely interconnected enterprises that align their production, logistics and procurement with one another thus enjoy a competitive advantage in the market. To achieve a close alignment, an instant, robust and efficient information flow along the supply chain between and within enterprises is required. However, less efficient human communication is often used instead of automatic systems because of the great diversity of enterprise systems and models. This paper describes an approach and its implementation SCM Intelligence App, which enables the configuration of individual supply chains together with the execution of industry accepted performance metrics. Based on machine-processable supply chain data model (the SCORVoc RDF vocabulary implementing the SCOR standard) and W3C standardized protocols such as SPARQL, the approach represents an alternative to closed software systems, which lack support for inter-organizational supply chain analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach using a prototypical implementation and a test scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {Coherent and consistent tracking of provenance data and in particular update history information is a crucial building block for any serious information system architecture. Version Control Systems can be a part of such an architecture enabling users to query and manipulate versioning information as well as content revisions. In this paper, we introduce an RDF versioning approach as a foundation for a full featured RDF Version Control System. We argue that such a system needs support for all concepts of the RDF specification including support for RDF datasets and blank nodes. Furthermore, we placed special emphasis on the protection against unperceived history manipulation by hashing the resulting patches. In addition to the conceptual analysis and an RDF vocabulary for representing versioning information, we present a mature implementation which captures versioning information for changes to arbitrary RDF datasets.},

This provides a technical infrastructure for business communication acts such as supply chain communication or master data management.
