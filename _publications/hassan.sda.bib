  Abstract                 = {The improvement of public health is one of the main indicators for societal progress. Statistical data for monitoring public health is highly relevant for a number of sectors, such as research (e.g. in the life sciences or economy), policy making, health care, pharmaceutical industry, insurances etc. Such data is meanwhile available even on a global scale, e.g. in the Global Health Observatory (GHO) of the United Nations's World Health Organization (WHO). GHO comprises more than 50 different datasets, it covers all 198 WHO member countries and is updated as more recent or revised data becomes available or when there are changes to the methodology being used. However, this data is only accessible via complex spreadsheets and, therefore, queries over the 50 different datasets as well as combinations with other datasets are very tedious and require a significant amount of manual work. By making the data available as RDF, we lower the barrier for data re-use and integration. In this article, we describe the conversion and publication process as well as use cases, which can be implemented using the GHO data. },

  Abstract                 = {Providing accurate approaches for keyword search or question answering to access the data available on the Linked Data Web is of central importance to ensure that it can be used by non-experts. In many cases, these approaches return a large number of results that need to be provided in the right order so as to be of relevance to the user. Achieving the goal of improving the access to the Linked Data Web thus demands the provision of ranking approaches that allow sorting potentially large number of results appropriately. While such functions have been designed in previous works, they have not been evaluated exhaustively. This work addresses this research gap by proposing a formal framework designed towards comparing and evaluating different ranking functions for RDF data. The framework allows combining these rankings by means of an extension of the Spearman's footrule estimation of the upper bound of this function. We supply a benchmark with a total of 60 manually annotated entity ranks by users from USA and India recruited over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Moreover, we evaluated nine entity ranking functions over the proposed benchmark.},

  Abstract                 = {Interlinking knowledge bases are widely recognized as an important, but challenging problem. A significant amount of research has been undertaken to provide solutions to this problem with varying degrees of automation and user involvement. In this paper, we present a two-staged experiment for the creation of gold standards that act as benchmarks for several interlinking algorithms. In the first stage the gold standards are generated through manual validation process highlighting the role of users. Using the gold standards obtained from this stage, we assess the performance of human evaluators in addition to supervised interlinking algorithms. We evaluate our approach on several data interlinking tasks with respect to precision, recall and F-measure. Additionally we perform a qualitative analysis on the types of errors made by humans and machines.},
